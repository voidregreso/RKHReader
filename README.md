# RKHReader
A tool rewritten in pure C++ code in order to read the root key hash from most Qualcomm-signed binaries, DSP firmware, and partitions, for both older and modern Qualcomm devices.

*This project is based on [RKHReader](https://github.com/WOA-Project/RKHReader), rewritten in C++ for cross-platform support. Many thanks to the original author!*
